# Vigenère Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This is a Python program for encrypting and decrypting text using the Vigenère cipher. The repository includes two scripts: one for encryption and one for decryption.

## Encryption

### Usage

To encrypt a plaintext message using the Vigenère cipher, run the `vigenere_encrypt.py` script. Follow the instructions to enter the key and plaintext message.

```bash
python vigenere_encrypt.py
```

The encrypted ciphertext will be displayed.

## Decryption

### Usage

To decrypt a Vigenère cipher text using the key, run the `vigenere_decrypt.py` script. Follow the instructions to enter the key and the ciphertext.

```bash
python vigenere_decrypt.py
```

The decrypted plaintext will be displayed.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Key Features

- Encryption and decryption of text using the Vigenère cipher.
- Supports keys of varying lengths.
- User-friendly input prompts and clear output.

## Example

For example, to encrypt the plaintext "HELLO" with the key "KEY," you would run the encryption script, provide the key "KEY," and enter the plaintext "HELLO." The output would be the ciphertext.

Similarly, to decrypt the ciphertext with the key "KEY," you would run the decryption script, provide the key "KEY," and enter the ciphertext. The output would be the original plaintext "HELLO."
